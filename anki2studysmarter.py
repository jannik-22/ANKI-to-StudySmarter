    Inserts line breaks before uppercase letters â€“ but only if the preceding
    character does NOT belong to the forbidden characters list.
    
    **Forbidden characters:** '(', '[', '{', '/', '-', ',', '.', ':', ';', or a space.
    
    **Logic:**
    - If an uppercase letter is found, the algorithm first checks whether it appears
      immediately after a forbidden character. If so, the entire following uppercase block
      is taken without inserting a line break.
    - If the uppercase letter does NOT appear after a forbidden character, the length of the
      uppercase block is determined:
      - If the length is **1 or 2**, a line break is inserted **before** the block,
        and the entire block is retained.
      - If the length is **greater than 2**, it is likely an abbreviation (e.g., "USA"),
        and the block is taken without a line break.
